# add-money

## Description

I made this app to save payments made to me in Venezuela where I live, and thus be able to keep track of how much money I receive. And yes, there are many applications that keep this record, but this is what makes it special for me and the reason why I did it is because it automatically converts from bs to usd and vice versa.
